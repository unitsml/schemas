== Usage

=== Generate latest UnitsML XSD (`unitsml/unitsml-v{version}.xsd`)

UnitsML XSD schema incorporates data from
https://github.com/unitsml/unitsdb[UnitsDB],
including prefixes and units.

When necessary, the latest UnitsML XSD should be re-generated
with the corresponding version of the UnitsDB.

NOTE: Version definition of the latest UnitsML XSD is defined in the `Makefile`.

[source,sh]
----
make unitsml/unitsml-v1.0.xsd
----


=== Generate XSD documentation (under `docs/`)

Generation of XSD documentation depends on the following tools:

* https://github.com/metanorma/xs3p[xs3p] for generating documentation
* https://github.com/metanorma/xsdvi[xsdvi] for the generation of diagrams,
  which depends on http://xerces.apache.org[Apache Xerces]

Command to generate documentation under `docs/`:

[source,sh]
----
make docs
----

This command will download all necessary dependencies under `.archives/`
and place them in corresponding paths.
